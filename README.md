# freddyboy Website Built With React (7/4/22)

In the process of learning React and adding dynamic elements to static music website.

## Background

Originally made the website with EJS, using partials for the navbar and footer. Learning to implement React through the use of components.

## Goals

Get creative with the mainpage, possible animate a shape (example static image of album/single art put as main landing of homepage). Implement interesting navbar (animated hamburger menu?). Brainstorm unique UI to help convey musical project.

## Status

- Finding a way to make otherworks img to look better on MusicPage. Linking a new component with other works list as a hidden part of the website (acts as a producer/composer CV). Make hamburger menu work on mobile. Working through responsivity of website. Start Any other cool npm features that can be installed or learnt from building this website?

-possibly get rid of Merch page? Sell merch on ig and bandcamp instead.

- Resizing navbar and animate hamburger menu
